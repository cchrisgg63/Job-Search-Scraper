This dynamic Job Search is a website scraper that will pull the information from a job search website of your choosing and provide recent job listing information to you. Also, by user choice, you can receive the job link to apply.

I wanted to create a program for young adults that are interested in finding jobs in a quicker manner. This significantly cuts down the process of looking on a job employment website, typing in all your information, your city, and etc just to find a job. Instead, you can run this program and it will automatically have those filters predetrermined for you and pull the most recent jobs so you can consistently use this program. Normally, companies will notify you of their job listings but sometimes they can get drowned in other emails. Some websites do not have every filter convient for you to use everytime you login. Sometimes, you will have to manually input your preferences yourself. This program will automatically have Illinois preset and provide the recent job listings. From there, you can determine if that job is within your scope and you are provided the link to further apply.

The final product of the project are screenshotted below. They will show you the output and the website redirect that occurs if the user says yes to the program.

NOTES

HTML will likely change and need to update class_="css-1q2dra3" and other class selectors in the script.
This script is interactive, it asks if you want each job URL by typing yes or no. 
Added choice program later to allow the user to interact with the program. 
Added URL links to the job posting too for real-time appliciability
